  *Specific Cases*\n\
  If you would like to enable or disable notification to given animes/mangas, you can do that directly through the media in your lists.\n\n\
  Would you really like to disable *ALL* of the __episodes__ and __news__ notifications?"

  I won't follow you or anything, is simple: right now I'm running in a server, if you want to change your time for notifications and choose to be notified 13h, it will be 13h in the server time ‚Äî that uses the UTC standard.\n\
  If you want to be notified in 13h in your country, I need to know what country is first.\n\
  Or you can also calculate your time in UTC hours; just a little reminder, of your country ‚Äî like of my own creator ‚Äî that has daylight saving, you need to consider that also.\n\n\
