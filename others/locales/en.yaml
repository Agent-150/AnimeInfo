  *Anime Time Calculator*\n\n\
  Just a calculator of how much time you have passed watching anime.\n\n\
  *User Language*\n\n\
  By default I work with your Telegram language, if not provided my default language is English. If you want change that, go to _User_ tab and change this.\n\n\
  *User Location*\n\n\
  _\"WHY ASKY MY LOCATION???\"_ — You\n\n\
  I won't follow you or anything, is simple: right now I'm running in a server, if you want to change your time for notifications and choose to be notified 13h, it will be 13h in the server time — that uses the UTC standard.\n\
  If you want to be notified in 13h in your country, I need to know what country is first.\n\
  Or you can also calculate your time in UTC hours; just a little remminder, if your country — like of my own creator — that has daylight saving, you need to consider that also.\n\n\
  *Watchlist/Readlist*\n\n\
  To see more info about your anime/manga just presse _More Info_ button.\n\n\
  *Notifications*\n\n\
  Notifications are enabled for all airing animes by default. If you want to disable it open _User_ tab then click in _Notify_.\n\
  If you want to disable or enable specifc animes, open it watchlist and then click more info.\n\
  Or event if want set a time of the day for recive all notifications, click in _Time_ in _User_ tab."
