> A new code base to Anilist bot in Telegram.

## About
This bot helps you to send info about:
* Animes
* Mangas
* Characters
* Studios
* Staffs
* etc

More than this it also notifies you when new episodes are released and lets you have a watch and a read list of it.

### Disclaimer
By default all the commands are in English, but you can see if the same command is available in your language.

# How to use it
First of all, talk to [@AnilistBot](http://t.me/anilistbot).

## Help
If you have any other questions about it just use it the help command:

```
/help
```

# How does it work?
You can build yourself a bot similar to this one, I've wrote a tutorial about it in my [Podesearch Bot](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot) just follow the procedures listed in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot/blob/master/docs/building/BUILDING.md).

# Artwork
I've made all the artwork for it, [Studio Ghibli](https://www.studioghibli.com.au/) was my inspiration.

You can see more in the [img](./others/img) folder.

# Contributing
Please, I'm not a native/fluent english speaker, so whether you see a variable name wrote the wrong way or even some comment where I've wrote something with the wrong "past perfect way of life" or something like that, please let me know it. Not always is just about the code, but rather making it more clear to other people to learn from it.

So, whether is code or not you can help me out making this code more accessible by reading the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

# TODO
Since I will be keeping this README up to date with any major change and I don't use any versioning system to log all the fixed bugs or previous projects updates, you can still have a taste of what comes next and what is being under analysis right in the [Projects](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/AnilistBot/projects/) tab.
