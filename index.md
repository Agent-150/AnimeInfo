> A new code base to Anilist bot in Telegram.

## About
This bot helps you to send info in your [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chats about:
* Animes
* Mangas
* Characters
* Studios
* Staffs
* etc

More than this it also notifies you when new episodes are released and lets you have a:
* Watchlist
* Readlist
* Countdown from new episodes
* Anime and manga filters in your lists

All of the data about it is fetched from [Anilist](http://anilist.co/) & [Anichart](http://anichart.net/).

## Disclaimer
1. [JoshStar](https://github.com/joshstar) was kind to [allow](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs/issues/50#event-1794658906) me to store the translated info about the content in different languages, improving the user experience;
2. This project is a new implementation, the old code base is [here](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Anilist-bot).

## Supported languages:
By default all the commands are in English, but you can see if the same command is available in your language. Only English and Portuguese had some kind of review, the others are automatic translation from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).

* [English](./others/locales/en.yaml)
* [Portuguese - Brazil](./others/locales/pt.yaml)

# Contributing
Please, I'm not a native/fluent english speaker, so whether you see a variable name wrote the wrong way or even some comment where I've wrote something with the wrong "past perfect way of life" or something like that, please let me know it. Not always is just about the code, but rather making it more clear to other people to learn from it.

So, whether is code or not you can help me out making this code more accessible by reading the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# TODO
Since I will be keeping this README up to date with any major change and I don't use any versioning system to log all the fixed bugs or previous projects updates, you can still have a taste of what comes next and what is being under analysis right in the [Projects](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/AnilistBot/projects/) tab.

# How does it work?
You can build yourself a bot similar to this one, I've wrote a tutorial about it in my [Podesearch Bot](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot) just follow the procedures listed in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot/blob/master/docs/building/BUILDING.md).

# Artwork
I've made all the artwork for it, [Studio Ghibli](https://www.studioghibli.com.au/) was my inspiration.

# Authors
* Only [me](https://github.com/Fazendaaa) for now.

This bot actually uses three paid services:
1. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)
2. [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
3. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)

All of your support actually makes a difference to help me maintain this project up and running. I really would love if anyone who uses it could support it helping one time with any value that think it worth it or even supporting it each month with one dollar through my Patreon. And this would allow me to improve this project more and more, adding a ton of features that I've planned.

Consider buy me a coffee:
